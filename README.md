#### Project Description

A simple cash register program that takes in user input for the price of the item and the amount
payed. The program will then calculate how many bills and coins to give back so that it uses the 
least amount possible.


#### How to Run This Program

Once started up, the user will be prompted to enter an item's price and how much they are paying 
for it. If the item is more expensive than the amount provided the program will inform the user 
and then prompt the user again. If the amount given is the exact same amount as the item's price
the program will inform the user. The program will continue running until the user enters '0' for
both the price of the item and the amount payed.
